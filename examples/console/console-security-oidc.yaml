#
# This example demonstrates the use of an OIDC provider at `.spec.security.oidc`
# for user authentication in the console. Any OIDC provider should work - such as
# Keycloak or dex with a suitable backend identity provider.
#
# In addition to the OIDC configuration, this example shows how to configure
# subjects and roles for user authorization. Note that global resources (kafka clusters)
# are configured within `.spec.security` whereas resources within a specific Kafka
# cluster are configured within `.spec.kafkaClusters[].security`.
# Replace <placeholders> with actual values specific to the environment.
