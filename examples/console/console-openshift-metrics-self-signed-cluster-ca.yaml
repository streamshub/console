#
# This example demonstrates using OpenShift user-workload monitoring as
# a source of Kafka metrics for the console. This configuration uses the
# `openshift-monitoring` metrics source type. The connection between a
# `metricsSources` entry and a `kafkaClusters` entry is established through 
# the `metricsSource` specified for the Kafka cluster.
#
# See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html
# for details on how to enable monitoring of user-defined projects in OpenShift.
