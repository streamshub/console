# StreamsHub Console Documentation

The documentation is written in [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/) and can be built locally using [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/):

```shell
asciidoctor index.adoc
```

This will build the docs as single page (`index.html`).

The docs are published via the main StreamsHub site [repository](https://github.com/streamshub/streamshub-site) and can be viewed on the main site at: [https://www.streamshub.io/](https://www.streamshub.io/).
All released versions (via git specified git tags), as well as the current `main` branch, of the docs will be published.
