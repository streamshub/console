= Navigating the StreamsHub Console

[role="_abstract"]
When you open the StreamsHub Console, the homepage presents a list of connected Kafka clusters. 
By clicking on a Kafka cluster name on the homepage or from the side menu, you can find information on the following components:

Kafka clusters:: A group of Kafka brokers and management components.
Brokers:: A broker contains topics and orchestrates the storage and passing of messages.
Topics:: A topic provides a destination for the storage of data. Kafka splits each topic into one or more partitions.
Partitions:: A subset of a topic used for data sharding and replication. The number of partitions is defined in the topic configuration.
Consumer groups:: Kafka groups consumers with the same group ID and distributes messages across group members. Consumers within a group receive data from one or more partitions.

For example, you can view the status of a Kafka cluster before navigating to view information on the clusterâ€™s brokers and topics, or the consumer groups connected to the Kafka cluster.
