= Navigating the StreamsHub Console

[role="_abstract"]
When you open the StreamsHub Console, the homepage displays a list of connected Kafka clusters. 
Click a cluster name to view its details from the following pages:

Cluster overview:: Displays high-level information about the Kafka cluster, including its status, key metrics, and resource utilization.
Nodes:: Provides details on broker and controller nodes, including their roles, operational status, and partition distribution.
Topics:: Lists topics and their configurations, including partition-specific information and connected consumer groups.
Consumer groups:: Displays consumer group activity, including offsets, lag metrics, and partition assignments.

Start with the cluster overview, then drill down into individual nodes, inspect topic configurations, or monitor consumer group activity.

NOTE: If the side menu for navigation of a cluster is hidden, click the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) in the console header.
