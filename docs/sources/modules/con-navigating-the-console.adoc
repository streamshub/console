Cluster overview:: Summarizes cluster status, key metrics, and resource usage.
Nodes:: Details broker and controller nodes, including roles, status, and partition distribution.
Topics:: Lists topics with configuration details, partition data, and associated groups.
Kafka Connect:: Displays information about Kafka Connect clusters, including connector status, configuration details, and available plugins.
Kafka Users:: Lists Kafka users associated with the selected cluster and shows the namespace for each user.
Consumer groups:: Shows group activity, offsets, lag metrics, and partition assignments.

NOTE: If the cluster navigation menu is hidden, click the navigation menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the console header to reveal it.

== Choose how the console looks
