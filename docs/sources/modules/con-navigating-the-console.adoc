= Navigating the StreamsHub Console

[role="_abstract"]
When you open the StreamsHub Console, the homepage lists all connected Kafka clusters.
You can explore each cluster through the following views:

Cluster overview:: Summarizes cluster status, key metrics, and resource usage.
Nodes:: Details broker and controller nodes, including roles, status, and partition distribution.
Topics:: Lists topics with configuration details, partition data, and associated consumer groups.
Kafka Connect:: Displays information about Kafka Connect clusters, including connector status, configuration details, and available plugins.
Consumer groups:: Shows activity, offsets, lag metrics, and partition assignments.

Begin with the cluster overview, then drill down into nodes, topics, Kafka Connect, or consumer groups as needed.

NOTE: If the cluster navigation menu is hidden, click the hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) in the console header to reveal it.

== Choose how the console looks

The StreamsHub Console supports three theme options: *Light*, *Dark*, and *System*.  
When set to *System*, the console automatically matches your operating system’s theme preference.

To change the theme, click the theme icon (sun/moon) in the console header. 
This opens the theme selector, where you can choose your preferred appearance.
