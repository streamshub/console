= Checking topic configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Check the configuration of a specific topic from the *Configuration* tab.
The *Configuration* tab presents a list of configuration values for the topic.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Kafka cluster in the StreamsHub Console, then click *Topics*.
. From the *Topics* page, click the name of the topic you want to inspect.
. Check the information on the *Configuration* tab.

You can filter for the properties you want to check, including selecting by data source:

* *DEFAULT_CONFIG* properties have a predefined default value. This value is used when there are no user-defined values for those properties. 
* *STATIC_BROKER_CONFIG* properties have predefined values that apply to the entire broker and, by extension, to all topics managed by that broker. This value is used when there are no user-defined values for those properties. 
* *DYNAMIC_TOPIC_CONFIG* property values have been configured for a specific topic and override the default configuration values.

TIP: The Strimzi Topic Operator simplifies the process of creating managing Kafka topics using `KafkaTopic` resources.
