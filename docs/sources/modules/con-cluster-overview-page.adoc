[role="_abstract"]
The *Cluster overview* page shows the status of a Kafka cluster. 
Use this page to assess broker readiness, identify cluster errors or warnings, and monitor overall health.

At a glance, the page displays:

* Number of topics and partitions
* Replication status
* Cluster metrics:
** Used disk space
** CPU utilization
** Memory usage
* Topic metrics:
** Total incoming byte rate
** Total outgoing byte rate

Metrics are presented as interactive charts.

* For *Cluster metrics*, use the dropdown menu to view data for a specific node or for all nodes.  
* For *Topic metrics*, use the dropdown menu to view data for a specific topic or for all topics.  

You can adjust the time range for the charts, from the last 5 minutes up to 7 days.
