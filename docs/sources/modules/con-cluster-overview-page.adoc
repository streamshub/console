[role="_abstract"]
The *Cluster overview* page shows the status of a Kafka cluster. 
Here, you can assess the readiness of Kafka brokers, identify any cluster errors or warnings, and gain insights into the cluster's health.
At a glance, the page provides information on the number of topics and partitions within the cluster, along with their replication status. 
Explore cluster metrics through charts displaying used disk space, CPU utilization, and memory usage. 
Additionally, topic metrics offer a comprehensive view of total incoming and outgoing byte rates for all topics in the Kafka cluster.
