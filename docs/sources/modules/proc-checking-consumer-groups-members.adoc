= Checking consumer group members

[role="_abstract"]
Check the members of a specific consumer group from the *Consumer Groups* page.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Kafka cluster in the StreamsHub Console, then click *Consumer Groups*. 
. On the *Consumer Groups* page, click the name of the consumer group you want to inspect.
. Click on the right arrow (>) next to a member ID to view the topic partitions a member is associated with, as well as any possible consumer lag.
+
For each group member, you see the unique (consumer) client ID assigned to the consumer within the consumer group, overall consumer lag, and the number of assigned partitions.
+
Any consumer lag for a specific topic partition reflects the gap between the last message a consumer has picked up (committed offset position) and the latest message written by the producer (end offset position).
