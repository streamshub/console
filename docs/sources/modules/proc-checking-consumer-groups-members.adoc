= Checking consumer group members

[role="_abstract"]
Check the members of a specific consumer group from the *Consumer Groups* page.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Kafka cluster in the StreamsHub Console, then click *Consumer Groups*. 
. From the *Consumer Groups* page, click the name of the consumer group you want to inspect.
. Click on the right arrow (>) next to a member ID to view the topic partitions a member is associated with, as well as any possible consumer lag.

For each group member, you see the unique (consumer) client ID assigned to the consumer within the consumer group, overall consumer lag, and the number of assigned partitions.

Any consumer lag for a specific topic partition reflects the gap between the last message a consumer has picked up (committed offset position) and the latest message written by the producer (end offset position).
