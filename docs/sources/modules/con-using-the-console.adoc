The StreamsHub Console provides a web interface for administering Kafka clusters. 
It delivers real-time insights to help you monitor, manage, and troubleshoot cluster performance.

After connecting a Kafka cluster managed by Strimzi, you can monitor cluster health and resources, inspect Kafka Connect components, and check users and groups associated with the cluster.
