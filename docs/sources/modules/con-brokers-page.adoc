= Brokers page

[role="_abstract"]
The *Brokers* page shows all the brokers created for a Kafka cluster. 
For each broker, you can see its status, as well as the distribution of partitions across the brokers, including the number of partition leaders and followers.

The broker status is shown as one of the following:

Not Running:: The broker has not yet been started or has been explicitly stopped.
Starting:: The broker is initializing and connecting to the cluster, including discovering and joining the metadata quorum.
Recovery:: The broker has joined the cluster but is in recovery mode, replicating necessary data and metadata before becoming fully operational. It is not serving clients.
Running:: The broker is fully operational, registered with the controller, and actively serving client requests.
Pending Controlled Shutdown:: The broker has initiated a controlled shutdown process and will shut down gracefully once complete.
Shutting Down:: The broker is in the process of shutting down. Client connections are being closed, and internal resources are being released.
Unknown:: The broker's state is unknown, possibly due to an unexpected error or failure.

If the broker has a rack ID, this is the ID of the rack or datacenter in which the broker resides.

Click on the right arrow (>) next to a broker name to see more information about the broker, including its hostname and disk usage.

Click on the *Rebalance* tab to show any rebalances taking place on the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Consider rebalancing if the distribution is uneven to ensure efficient resource utilization.
