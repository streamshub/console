= Nodes page

[role="_abstract"]
The *Nodes* page lists all nodes created for a Kafka cluster, including nodes that perform broker, controller, or dual roles.
You can filter the list by node pool, role (broker or controller), or status.

For each node, you can view its status.
For broker nodes, the page shows partition distribution across the cluster, including the number of partition leaders and followers.

Broker status is shown as one of the following:

Not Running:: The broker has not yet been started or has been explicitly stopped.
Starting:: The broker is initializing and connecting to the cluster. It is discovering and joining the metadata quorum.
Recovery:: The broker has joined the cluster but is in recovery mode. It is replicating necessary data and metadata before becoming fully operational. It is not yet serving client requests.
Running:: The broker is fully operational. It is registered with the controller and serving client requests.
Pending Controlled Shutdown:: The broker has initiated a controlled shutdown. It will shut down gracefully after completing in-flight operations.
Shutting Down:: The broker is shutting down. Client connections are closing, and internal resources are being released.
Unknown:: The broker's state is unknown, possibly due to an unexpected error or failure.

If the broker has a rack ID, it identifies the rack or datacenter in which the broker resides.

Controller status is shown as one of the following, describing the controllerâ€™s role within the metadata quorum:

Quorum leader:: The controller is the active leader, coordinating cluster metadata updates and managing operations like partition reassignments and broker registrations.
Quorum follower:: The controller is a follower in the metadata quorum, passively replicating updates from the leader while maintaining a synchronized state. It is ready to take over as the leader if needed.
Quorum follower lagged:: The controller is a follower but has fallen behind the leader. It is not fully up to date with the latest metadata and may be ineligible for leader election until it catches up.
Unknown:: The controller's state is unknown, possibly due to an unexpected error or failure.

Click on the right arrow (>) next to a node name to view more information about the node, including its hostname and disk usage.

Click on the *Rebalance* tab to show any rebalances taking place on the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Consider rebalancing if partition distribution is uneven to ensure efficient resource utilization.
