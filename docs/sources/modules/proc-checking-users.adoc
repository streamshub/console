View authentication details and authorization rules for a specific Kafka user from the *Kafka Users* page.

.Procedure

. Log in to the StreamsHub Console, select a Kafka cluster, and click *Kafka Users*.
. (Optional) Enter a username in the search field to filter the list.
. Click the username of the user you want to inspect.
+
. Review the user details:
+
Name:: The name of the Kafka user resource.
Username:: The Kafka username.
Authentication:: The configured authentication type.
Namespace:: The namespace where the user is defined.
Creation Time:: The date and time the user was created.
+
. Review the *Authorization* section:
+
* If no rules are configured, the page displays *No authorization rules*.
* If authorization rules are configured, a table lists the details of each configured access control rule. 
Each rule specifies the resources and operations to which it applies, and whether access is allowed or denied.
+
Type:: The resource type, such as `topic`, `group`, or `cluster`.
Name:: The name of the resource. 
For `cluster` resource types, no name is specified.
Pattern type:: The pattern used to match the resource name. 
`literal` matches the exact name specified. 
`prefix` applies the rule to all resources with names that start with the specified value. 
With the `literal` pattern type, the name can be set to `*` to apply the rule to all resources.
Host:: The host to which the rule applies. An asterisk (`*`) indicates any host.
Operations:: One or more operations to which the rule applies, shown as a comma-separated list, such as `Read` or `Describe`. 
Supported operations depend on the resource type.
Permission:: The permission type, such as `allow` or `deny`.
