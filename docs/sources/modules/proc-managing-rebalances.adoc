= Managing rebalances

[role="_abstract"]
When you configure `KafkaRebalance` resources to generate optimization proposals on a cluster, you can check their status from the *Rebalance* tab.
The *Rebalance* tab presents a chronological list of `KafkaRebalance` resources from which you can manage the optimization proposals.
You can filter the list by name, status, or rebalance mode.

NOTE: Cruise Control must be enabled to run alongside the Kafka cluster in order to use the *Rebalance* tab. For more information on setting up and using Cruise Control to generate proposals, see the link:{BookURLDeploying}[Strimzi documentation^]. 

.Procedure

. Log in to the Kafka cluster in the StreamsHub Console, then click *Kafka nodes*. 
. Check the information on the *Rebalance* tab.
+
For each rebalance, you can view its status and the time it was last updated.

.Rebalance status descriptions
[cols="1m,1",options="header"]
|===
|Status |Description
|New|Resource has not been observed by the operator before 
|PendingProposal|Optimization proposal not generated 
|ProposalReady|Optimization proposal is ready for approval
|Rebalancing|Rebalance in progress
|Stopped|Rebalance stopped
|NotReady|Error ocurred with the rebalance
|Ready|Rebalance complete
|ReconciliationPaused|Rebalance is paused
|===

NOTE: The status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource changes to `ReconciliationPaused` when the `strimzi.io/pause-reconciliation` annotation is set to `true` in its configuration.

. Click on the right arrow (>) next to a rebalance name to view more information about the broker, including its rebalance mode, and whether auto-approval is enabled.
If the rebalance involved brokers being removed or added, they are also listed.

Optimization proposals can be generated in one of three modes:

* `full` is the default mode and runs a full rebalance.
* `add-brokers` is the mode used after adding brokers when scaling up a Kafka cluster.
* `remove-brokers` is the mode used before removing brokers when scaling down a Kafka cluster.

If auto-approval is enabled for a proposal, a successfully generated proposal goes straight into a cluster rebalance.  

.Viewing optimization proposals

Click on the name of a `KafkaRebalance` resource to view a generated optimization proposal.
An optimization proposal is a summary of proposed changes that would produce a more balanced Kafka cluster, with partition workloads distributed more evenly among the brokers.

For more information on the properties shown on the proposal and what they mean, see the link:{BookURLDeploying}[Strimzi documentation^].

.Managing rebalances

Select the options icon (three vertical dots) and click on an option to manage a rebalance. 

* Click *Approve* to approve a proposal. +
The rebalance outlined in the proposal is performed on the Kafka cluster. 
* Click *Refresh* to generate a fresh optimization proposal. +
If there has been a gap between generating a proposal and approving it, refresh the proposal so that the current state of the cluster is taken into account with a rebalance.
* Click *Stop* to stop a rebalance. +
Rebalances can take a long time and may impact the performance of your cluster.
Stopping a rebalance can help avoid performance issues and allow you to revert changes if needed.

NOTE: The options available depend on the status of the `KafkaBalance` resource.
For example, it's not possible to approve an optimization proposal if it's not ready.
