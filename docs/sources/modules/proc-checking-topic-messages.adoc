= Checking topic messages

[role="_abstract"]
Track the flow of messages for a specific topic from the *Messages* tab.
The *Messages* tab presents a chronological list of messages for a topic.

.Procedure

. From the StreamsHub Console, log in to the Kafka cluster, then click *Topics*. 
. Click the name of the topic you want to check.
. Check the information on the *Messages* tab.
+
For each message, you can see its timestamp (in UTC), offset, key, and value.
+
By clicking on a message, you can see the full message details.
+
Click the *Manage columns* icon (represented as two columns) to choose the information to display.

. Click the search dropdown and select the advanced search options to refine your search.
+
Choose to display the latest messages or messages from a specified time or offset. 
You can display messages for all partitions or a specified partition.
+
When you are done, you can click the CSV icon (represented as a CSV file) to download the information on the returned messages. 

.Refining your search

In this example, search terms, and message, retrieval, and partition options are combined:

* `messages=timestamp:2024-03-01T00:00:00Z retrieve=50 partition=1 Error on page load where=value`

The filter searches for the text "Error on page load" in partition 1 as a message value, starting from March 1, 2024, and retrieves up to 50 messages.

Search terms:: Enter search terms as text (_has the words_) to find specific matches and define _where_ in a message to look for the term. You can search anywhere in the message or narrow the search to the key, header, or value.  
+
For example:
+
--
* `messages=latest retrieve=100 642-26-1594 where=key`
--
+
This example searches the latest 100 messages on message key `642-26-1594`. 

Message options:: Set the starting point for returning messages.
+
* *Latest* to start from the latest message.
** `messages=latest`
* *Timestamp* to start from an exact time and date in ISO 8601 format.  
** `messages=timestamp:2024-03-14T00:00:00Z`
* *Offset* to start from an offset in a partition. In some cases, you may want to specify an offset without a partition. 
However, the most common scenario is to search by offset within a specific partition.
** `messages=offset:5600253 partition=0` 
* *Unix Timestamp* to start from a time and date in Unix format. 
** `messages=epoch:1`

Retrieval options:: Set a retrieval option.
+
* *Number of messages* to return a specified number of messages.
** `messages=latest retrieve=50`
* *Continuously* to return the latest messages in real-time. Click the pause button (represented by two vertical lines) to pause the refresh. Unpause to continue the refresh.
** `retrieve=continuously`

Partition options:: Choose to run a search against all partitions or a specific partition.
