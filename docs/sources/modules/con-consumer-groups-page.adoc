= Consumer Groups page

[role="_abstract"]
The *Consumer Groups* page shows all the consumer groups associated with a Kafka cluster.
For each consumer group, you can see its status, the overall consumer lag across all partitions, and the number of members.
Click on associated topics to show the topic information available from the xref:con-topics-page-{context}[*Topics* page tabs]. 

Consumer group status can be one of the following:

* *Stable* indicates normal functioning
* *Rebalancing* indicates ongoing adjustments to the consumer groupâ€™s members.
* *Empty* suggests no active members. If in the empty state, consider adding members to the group.

Check group members by clicking on a consumer group name. 
Select the options icon (three vertical dots) against a consumer group to reset consumer offsets.
