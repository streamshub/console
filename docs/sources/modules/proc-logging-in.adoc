= Logging in to a Kafka cluster from the homepage

[role="_abstract"]
The console supports authenticated user login to a Kafka cluster using SCRAM-SHA-512 and OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanisms.
For secure login, authentication must be configured in your Strimzi managed Kafka cluster.

NOTE: If authentication is not set up for a Kafka cluster or the credentials have been provided using the Kafka `sasl.jaas.config` property (which defines SASL authentication settings) in the console configuration, you can log in anonymously to the cluster without authentication.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to a Kubernetes cluster.
* The console must be xref:assembly-deploying-{context}[deployed and set up to connect to a Kafka cluster].
* For secure login, you must have appropriate authentication settings for the Kafka cluster and user.

SCRAM-SHA-512 settings::
+
--
* Listener authentication set to `scram-sha-512` in `Kafka.spec.kafka.listeners[*].authentication`.
* Username and password configured in `KafkaUser.spec.authentication`.
--

OAuth 2.0 settings::
+
--
* An OAuth 2.0 authorization server with client definitions for the Kafka cluster and users.
* Listener authentication set to `oauth` in `Kafka.spec.kafka.listeners[*].authentication`.
--

For more information on configuring authentication, see the link:{BookURLDeploying}[Strimzi documentation^].

.Procedure

. From the homepage, optionally filter the list of clusters by name, then click *Login to cluster* for a selected Kafka cluster.
. Enter login credentials depending on the authentication method used.
+
* For SCRAM-SHA-512, enter the username and password associated with the `KafkaUser`. 
* For OAuth 2.0, provide a client ID and client secret that is valid for the OAuth provider configured for the Kafka listener.

. To end your session, click your username and select *Logout*, or return to the homepage.
