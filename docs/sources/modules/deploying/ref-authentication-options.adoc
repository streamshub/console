= Using an OIDC provider to secure access to Kafka clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Enable secure console connections to Kafka clusters using an OIDC provider.
Configure the console deployment to configure connections to any Identity Provider (IdP), such as Keycloak or Dex, that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).
Also define the subjects and roles for user authorization.
The security profiles can be configured for all Kafka cluster connections on a global level, though you can add roles and rules for specific Kafka clusters.

An example configuration is provided in the following file: `examples/console/console-security-oidc.yaml`.

The configuration introduces the following additional properties for console deployment:

`security`:: Properties that define the connection details for the console to connect with the OIDC provider.
`subjects`:: Specifies the subjects (users or groups) and their roles in terms of JWT claims or explicit subject names, determining access permissions.
`roles`:: Defines the roles and associated access rules for users, specifying which resources (like Kafka clusters) they can interact with and what operations they are permitted to perform.

If you want to specify roles and rules for individual Kafka clusters, add the details under `kafka.clusters[].security.roles[]`.
In the following example, the `console-kafka` cluster allows developers to list and view selected Kafka resources.
Administrators can also update certain resources.

== Optional OIDC authentication properties

The following properties can be used to further configure `oidc` authentication.  
These apply to any part of the console configuration that supports `authentication.oidc`, such as schema registries or metrics providers.

grantType::  
Specifies the OIDC grant type to use. Required when using non-interactive authentication flows, where no user login is involved.
Supported values:
+
* `CLIENT`: Requires a client ID and secret.  
* `PASSWORD`: Requires a client ID and secret, plus user credentials (`username` and `password`) provided through `grantOptions`.

grantOptions::  
Additional parameters specific to the selected grant type.  
Use `grantOptions` to provide properties such as `username` and `password` when using the `PASSWORD` grant type.
+
[source,yaml]
----
oidc:
  grantOptions:
    username: my-user
    password: <my_password>
----

method::  
Method for passing the client ID and secret to the OIDC provider.  
Supported values:
+
* `BASIC`: (default) Uses HTTP Basic authentication.  
* `POST`: Sends credentials as form parameters.

scopes::  
Optional list of access token scopes to request from the OIDC provider.  
Defaults are usually defined by the OIDC client configuration.  
Specify this property if access to the target service requires additional or alternative scopes not granted by default.
+
[source,yaml]
----
oidc:
  scopes:
    - openid
    - registry:read
    - registry:write
----

absoluteExpiresIn::  
Optional boolean. If set to `true`, the `expires_in` token property is treated as an absolute timestamp instead of a duration.
