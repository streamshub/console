= Deployment prerequisites

[role="_abstract"]
To deploy the console, you need the following:

* A Kubernetes {minKubernetesVersion} cluster.
* The `kubectl` command-line tool is installed and configured to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.
* Access to the Kubernetes cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions, such as `system-admin`.
* A Kafka cluster managed by Strimzi, running on the Kubernetes cluster.  

Example files are provided for installing a Kafka cluster managed by Strimzi, along with a Kafka user representing the console. 
These files offer the fastest way to set up and try the console, but you can also use your own Strimzi managed Kafka deployment.

== Using your own Kafka cluster

If you use your own Strimzi deployment, verify the configuration by comparing it with the example deployment files provided with the console.

For each Kafka cluster, the `Kafka` resource used to install the cluster must be configured with the following:

* Sufficient authorization for the console to connect
* Metrics properties for the console to be able to display certain data
+
The metrics configuration must match the properties specified in the example `Kafka` (`console-kafka`) and `ConfigMap` (`console-kafka-metrics`) resources.
