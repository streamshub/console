= Deploying a new Kafka cluster

[role="_abstract"]
If you already have Strimzi installed but want to create a new Kafka cluster for use with the console, example deployment resources are available to help you get started.

These resources create the following:

* A Kafka cluster in KRaft mode with SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication.
* A Strimzi `KafkaNodePool` resource to manage the cluster nodes.
* A `KafkaUser` resource to enable authenticated and authorized console connections to the Kafka cluster.

The `KafkaUser` custom resource in the `040-KafkaUser-console-kafka-user1.yaml` file includes the necessary ACL types to provide authorized access for the console to the Kafka cluster.

The minimum required ACL rules are configured as follows:

* `Describe`, `DescribeConfigs` permissions for the `cluster` resource
* `Read`, `Describe`, `DescribeConfigs` permissions for all `topic` resources
* `Read`, `Describe` permissions for all `group` resources

NOTE: To ensure the console has the necessary access to function, a minimum level of authorization must be configured for the principal used in each Kafka cluster connection. 
The specific permissions may vary based on the authorization framework in use, such as ACLs, Keycloak authorization, OPA, or a custom solution.

When configuring the `KafkaUser` authentication and authorization, ensure they match the corresponding `Kafka` configuration:

* `KafkaUser.spec.authentication` should match `Kafka.spec.kafka.listeners[*].authentication`.
* `KafkaUser.spec.authorization` should match `Kafka.spec.kafka.authorization`.

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes {minKubernetesVersion} cluster.
* Access to the Kubernetes web console using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions, such as `system:admin`.
* The `kubectl` command-line tool is installed and configured to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

.Procedure

. Download and extract the console installation artifacts.
+
The artifacts are included with installation and example files available from the link:{ReleaseDownload}[release page^].
+
The artifacts provide the deployment YAML files to the install the Kafka cluster.
Use the sample installation files located in `examples/kafka`. 

. Set environment variables to update the installation files:
+
[source,shell]
----
export NAMESPACE=kafka # <1>
export LISTENER_TYPE=route # <2>
export CLUSTER_DOMAIN=<domain_name> # <3>
----
<1> The namespace in which you want to deploy the Kafka operator.
<2> The listener type used to expose Kafka to the console.
<3> The cluster domain name for your Kubernetes cluster.
+
In this example, the namespace variable is defined as `kafka` and the listener type is `route`.

. Install the Kafka cluster.
+
Run the following command to apply the YAML files and deploy the Kafka cluster to the defined namespace:
+
[source,shell]
----
cat examples/kafka/*.yaml | envsubst | kubectl apply -n ${NAMESPACE} -f -
----
+
This command reads the YAML files, replaces the namespace environment variables, and applies the resulting configuration to the specified Kubernetes namespace.

. Check the status of the deployment:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc get pods -n kafka
----
+

.Output shows the operators and cluster readiness
[source,shell]
----
NAME                              READY   STATUS   RESTARTS
strimzi-cluster-operator          1/1     Running  0                    
console-kafka-console-nodepool-0  1/1     Running  0
console-kafka-console-nodepool-1  1/1     Running  0
console-kafka-console-nodepool-2  1/1     Running  0
----

* `console-kafka` is the name of the cluster.
* `console-nodepool` is the name of the node pool.
+
A node ID identifies the nodes created. 
+
With the default deployment, you install three nodes. 
+
READY shows the number of replicas that are ready/expected. 
The deployment is successful when the STATUS displays as Running.
