= Resetting consumer offsets

[role="_abstract"]
Reset the consumer offsets of a specific consumer group from the *Consumer Groups* page.

You might want to do this when reprocessing old data, skipping unwanted messages, or recovering from downtime.

.Prerequisites

All active members of the consumer group must be shut down before resetting the consumer offsets.

.Procedure

. Log in to the Kafka cluster in the StreamsHub Console, then click *Consumer Groups*. 

. Click the options icon (three vertical dots) for the consumer group and click the reset consumer offsets option to display the *Reset consumer offset* page.

. Choose to apply the offset reset to all consumer topics associated with the consumer group or select a specific topic.
+
If you selected a topic, choose to apply the offset reset to all partitions or select a specific partition.

. Choose the position to reset the offset:
+
* Custom offset (available only if you selected a specific topic _and_ a specific partition).
If you select this option, enter the custom offset value.
* Latest offset
* Earliest offset
* Specific date and time
* Delete committed offsets (available only if you selected a specific topic).
+
If you selected date and time, choose the appropriate format and enter the date in that format.
+
IMPORTANT: The *Delete committed offsets* option removes the stored offsets for the consumer group. 
When the group resumes, offset behavior depends on the consumer configuration (for example, the `auto.offset.reset` setting). 
Use this option with caution.

. (Optional) Perform a dry run before applying the offset reset.  
+
.. Click the down arrow next to *Dry run*.  
.. Choose the option to run the dry run and view the results in the console, or copy the command to run it independently against the consumer group.
+  
The results display the new offsets for each topic partition included in the reset operation.  
A download option is available for the results.

. Click *Reset* to perform the offset reset.
