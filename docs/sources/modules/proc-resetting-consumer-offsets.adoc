= Resetting consumer offsets

[role="_abstract"]
Reset the consumer offsets of a specific consumer group from the *Consumer Groups* page.

You might want to do this when reprocessing old data, skipping unwanted messages, or recovering from downtime.

.Prerequisites

All active members of the consumer group must be shut down before resetting the consumer offsets.

.Procedure

. From the StreamsHub Console, log in to the Kafka cluster, then click *Consumer Groups*. 
. Click the options icon (three vertical dots) for the consumer group and click the reset consumer offset option to display the *Reset consumer offset* page.
. Choose to apply the offset reset to all consumer topics associated with the consumer group or select a specific topic.
+
If you selected a topic, choose to apply the offset reset to all partitions or select a specific partition.
. Choose the position to reset the offset:
+
* Custom offset +
If you selected custom offset, enter the custom offset value.
* Latest offset
* Earliest offset
* Specific date and time +
If you selected date and time, choose the appropriate format and enter the date in that format. 
. Click *Reset* to perform the offset reset.

.Performing a dry run

Before actually executing the offset reset, you can use the dry run option to see which offsets would be reset before applying the change.

. From the *Reset consumer offset* page, click the down arrow next to *Dry run*.
. Choose the option to run and show the results in the console. +
Or you can copy the dry run command and run it independently against the consumer group.

The results in the console show the new offsets for each topic partition included in the reset operation.

A download option is available for the results.
