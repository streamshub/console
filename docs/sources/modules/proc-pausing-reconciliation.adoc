= Pausing reconciliation of clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Pause cluster reconciliations from the *Cluster overview* page by following these steps.
While paused, any changes to the cluster configuration using the `Kafka` custom resource are ignored until reconciliation is resumed.

.Procedure

. From the StreamsHub Console, log in to the Kafka cluster that you want to connect to, then click *Cluster overview* and *Pause reconciliation*.
. Confirm the pause, after which the *Cluster overview* page shows a change of status warning that reconciliation is paused.
. Click *Resume reconciliation* to restart reconciliation.

NOTE: If the status change is not displayed after pausing reconciliation, try refreshing the page.
