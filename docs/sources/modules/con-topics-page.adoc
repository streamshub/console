[role="_abstract"]
The *Topics* page shows all the topics created for a Kafka cluster. 
Use this page to check information on topics.

The *Topics* page shows the overall replication status for partitions in the topic, as well as counts for the partitions in the topic and the number of associated consumer groups.
The overall storage used by the topic is also shown.

[WARNING]
====
Internal topics must not be modified. You can choose to hide internal topics from the list of topics returned on the *Topics* page.

By clicking on a topic name, additional topic information is presented on a series of tabs:

Messages:: Messages shows the message log for a topic.
Partitions:: Partitions shows the replication status of each partition in a topic. 
Consumer groups:: Consumer groups lists the names and status of the consumer groups and group members connected to a topic.
Configuration:: Configuration shows the configuration of a topic.

If a topic is shown as *Managed*, it means that is managed using the Strimzi Topic Operator and was not created directly in the Kafka cluster. 

Use the information provided on the tabs to check and modify the configuration of your topics.
