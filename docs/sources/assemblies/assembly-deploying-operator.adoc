= Installing the console operator

[role="_abstract"]
Install the console operator using one of the following methods:

* By applying a `Console` Custom Resource Definition (CRD)
* By using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) command line interface (CLI)
* From the OperatorHub in the OpenShift web console (Openshift Clusters only)

The recommended approach is to install the operator via the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) resources.
If using the OLM is not suitable for your environment, you can install the operator by applying the CRD directly.
