= Deploying the console

[role="_abstract"]
Deploy the console using the dedicated operator.
After installing the operator, you can create instances of the console. 

For each console instance, the operator needs a Prometheus instance to collect and display Kafka cluster metrics. 
You can configure the console to use an existing Prometheus source.
If no source is set, the operator creates a private Prometheus instance when the console is deployed. 
However, this default setup is not recommended for production and should only be used for development or evaluation purposes.
