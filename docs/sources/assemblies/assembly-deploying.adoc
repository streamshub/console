= Deploying the console

[role="_abstract"]
Deploy the console using the dedicated operator.
After installing the operator, you can create instances of the console. 

For each console instance, the operator needs a Prometheus instance to collect and display Kafka cluster metrics. 
You can configure the console to use an existing Prometheus source.
If no source is set, the operator creates a private Prometheus instance when the console is deployed. 
However, this default setup is not recommended for production and should only be used for development or evaluation purposes.

Connect the console to one or more Kafka clusters to provide visibility into topics, Kafka nodes, and consumer groups.

Configure the console to integrate with related services, including:

* **Authentication providers** for securing access to Kafka clusters
* **Kafka Connect clusters** for viewing connector and configuration details
* **Metrics providers** for monitoring Kafka cluster performance
* **Schema registries** for managing and validating data schemas

Define these integrations in the `Console` custom resource configuration YAML file.
